# Introduction to Python

## Documentation

Official python3 [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

## Task 1:

a) write a function "fib" that computes the fibonnaci function
f(0) = 1
f(1) = 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
n positive integer

b) write a function "fib_memo" that uses [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) to compute the fibonacci function

c) write a function called "fib_matrix_exp" that uses [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring) in order to compute the [fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Matrix_form) function

d) use the time package and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
to time and plot the execution time of all fibonacci implementations (a to c).
n = 10000, execute each function 10 times and take the average time it took to complete

Add the plot to this readme.

1. Installed Google Drive
2. Reset vscode
3. Synced git once more
4. Cloned adorable-wrestler repo to Google Drive
5. Added these lines to get comfy
6. I need to talk to myself to understand
7. Learning git functions. used: git status
8. I saved the readme file
9. I typed in git status again. It now tells me that readme.md was modified
10. I shall use git commit -a to commit all changes
11. git commit -a won't work. it requires me to close the file
12. Imma use the vscode's Commit icon
13. I have learned that between a change and commit there is a stage step which is for 2 major things: 1 - security and 2 - batches of files
14. I am using git add . to add it all
15. I have commited my changes.

## Branch vs main lesson
However, I should have: created a branch of main > call the brench using checkout > stage my changes > commit them > pull main to have the last updates of the file > merge updates to branch > determine and fix merge conflicts > stage my changes > commit them > push them.
Now, my collabs are notified and my changes are separated from the main.

This way, my changes will no longer be directly merged to main. I apologize. Lesson learned
